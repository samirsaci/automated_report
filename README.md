### Scenario
You are a **continuous improvement manager** at an international clothing group with stores worldwide.

The company produces garments, bags, and accessories in factories in Asia.

Stores are supplied from local warehouses, which factories directly replenish.

Regularly, you have to share warehouse operational metrics with your management.

This is a manual process in which you need to

- Extract data from the Warehouse Management System (WMS)
- Process data and build visuals with Excel
- Send a short report by email with the visuals and comments

#### Objective
To be efficient, you would like to automate this process using Python.

Your solution will be a simple Python script, deployed on the cloud, that will automatically perform these four steps:
1. Extract prepared order lines of last week from the WMS SQL database
2. Process the data and compute KPIs with key insights
3. Automatically send an HTML email with visuals and comments
