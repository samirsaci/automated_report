The company is producing garments, bags and accessories in factories located in Asia.

Stores are delivered from local warehouses that are directly replenished by factories.

</p>

On a regular basis, you have to share warehouse operational indicators with your management.

This is a manual process in which you need to

- Extract data from the Warehouse Management System (WMS)
- Process data and built visuals with Excel
- Send a short report by email with the visuals and comments

#### Objective
To be efficient, you would like to automate this process using Python.

Your solution will be a simple python script, deployed on the cloud, that will automatically perform these four steps:

1. Extract prepared order lines of last week from the WMS SQL database
2. Process the data and compute KPIs with key insights
3. Automatically send an HTML email with visuals and comments
